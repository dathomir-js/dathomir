## Before Implementation

**MUST READ:**
1. [SPEC.typ](./SPEC.typ) - Contains the specification and design decisions
2. [implementation.test.ts](./implementation.test.ts) - Contains the correctness criteria for implementation

These two files define what to implement and how to verify it is correct.

## Your Role

Implement the entries utility according to SPEC.typ while ensuring all test cases in implementation.test.ts pass.
